            The project served as a clear indication where my consultancy and management skills have their limits.
            That is: I don't really function well when completely exposed on all sides with a high-difficulty

        <h2>Summary</h2>
            I converted an ailing QA team into a functional Test Engineering
            chapter in a Scaling Agile model.<br/>
            The process involved
        <ul><li>
            defining roles and development paths for my engineers, then training
            them in the skills required to progress on those paths;
        </li><li>
            identifying my engineers' individual strengths and leveraging them,
            adjusting their deployment to dev teams as needs changed;
        </li><li>
            working closely with Product Lead developing BDD practices across
            the prod-tech teams and then fleshing out the squad=specific details
            with product owners;
        </li><li>
            contributing to the evolving Scaling Agile model, inluding some of the
            company's first OKR's;
        </li><li>
            steering the development of technical tools to keep the processes
            going smoothly, delegating as much of coding as possible to the
            engineers (against my natural tendencies which would interfere
            with my engineers' growth).
        </li></ul>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        After about 1.5y of my tenure, the QA team with 2 permanent employees
        focused on their hopeful transfer to Front End Development became
        a Test Engineering chapter with 2 contractors considered indispensable
        by their squads and 4 engineers contributing to constant
        improvement of the product and their own skillsets, be it learning to
        create E2E frameworks, harnessing mobile testing regimes or using
        psychological wiles to influence the least co-operative of the
        product owners. Unit test coverage for front-end code became an actual
        tracked parameter and jumped to over 70% within a few months since our
        initial spiking sessions for Mocha/Chai and React tools for testing.
        <h2>Daily duties</h2>
        <ul><li>
            BDD evangelism.
        </li><li>
            Line management of the permanent employees, occasional intervention in the matters concering the remote contractors.
        </li><li>
            Spikes, code reviews, code sketches. Pair programming, mentoring, letting people actually get on with their jobs.
        </li><li>
            Planning and designing new testing regimes and processes in collaboration with others leaders of tech of product.

            Calling the 3 Amigos sessions and playing the role of product owner, business analyst
            and the SDET while also reminding about the need for requirements to be expressed before the code gets written.

            Reviewing Pull Requests from QA PoV - sadly, frequently leading to much deeper improvements than strictly testing related.

            Finding compromises between company-wide official Immunisation scorecard for code quality and tech leads'

            The most satisfying outcome for me was the <a href="#prj-ctmsit">Systems Integration Testing</a> suite,
            which started as an attempt to finally have some holistic functional regression suite for Rewards team
            and quickly grew into the first integration test of multiple company stacks, from customer profile through
            external enquiry and sales tracking to actual rewards and their distribution (this meant de facto functional
            testing of subsystems hosted either on-premise or in Amazon EC or in Kubernetes, using application stacks
            ranging from Node.js to C#).
            <br/><br/>
            Side effects included challenging the established model of testing environments,
            their hosting and their very meaning.

            The fundamental idea here was to perform contract testing without mentioning scary terms like
            <i>contract testing</i> and exotic new technologies like Pact.js. This meant that the contract tests had
            to be performed indirectly and implicitly.
        </p><p>
            The reason to try and look for such compromise was a project which, besides delivering CtM's "The Last
            Jedi" campaign, also included almost complete restructuring of Rewards systems, including partial
            implementation of microservices.
        </p><p>
            The requirement for contract testing without contract testing tools was delivered by creating a comprehensive
            test suite in Cucumber which closely followed the Rewards Team's first requirements document. Underlying
            testing code was always simulating the designated client for feature under test, up to mimicking the requests
            from Rewards front-end page when used by a customer.
        </p><p>
            Cucumber scripts covered both journey and feature approach, since, for most of the subsystems under test, they
            were either inapplicable or missing. In both cases, no system owned by the company was stubbed, resulting in
            the first ever integration tests of multiple systems of CtM. Thus, SIT run results and diagnostic logs were the main
            way to address the numerous cross-team integration issues normally solved with Pact - however, due to removing it
            from developers orbit of day-to-day interest, SIT could only help with resolving issues that already happened, as
            opposed to Pact's capability to anticipate them.
        </p><p>
            Refusal to stub <i>anything CtM owns</i> additionally resulted in high volumes of cross-team
            communications facilitated by Testing Function and low-level managers, since - in several cases - attempts
                to run set-up code allowed us to detect external code entirely incompatible with fundamental
            assumptions of the Rewards project.
        </p><p>
            Finally, decision to use disposable customer accounts and peculiarities of CtM's customer profile systems
            resulted in cranking parallelisation up to 11, where Cucumber.js allows running every feature file in parallel,
            while the needs of SIT demanded parallel run of every test case with slight staggering to circumvent the
            customer profile's throttling mechanism. Final test results were then aggregated into a Bootstrap-themed
                report.

    <div class="description">
        <p>
            The idea of the <i>Smoke Testing</i> environment was born from several
            cases of botched code deployments, where software deemed working
            correctly (by developers and the product manager alike) turned out
            to be a showstopper in production.
        </p><p>
            I applied to Aframe specifically to work as a developer, not a QA
            specialist. Since nobody else in the dev team had any QA experience,
            the project ended up being my side task, encroaching on my duties
            as a developer and ultimately harming my career in the company.
            As final result, implementation was atrocious on many levels - except
            best possible coverage and simulation of real life situations.
        </p><p>
            Although named "Smoke", the contraption performed a much wider set of
            tests, starting with production-like deployment of the code and DB
            migrations, progressing through typical set of "did it explode?" actual
            smoke tests and then delving into a comprehensive suite of end-to-end
            regression/acceptance tests of the core Aframe product: the web app[s].
        </p><p>
            For highest possible fidelity to production environment, the tests were
            run over the network; the app was served via load balancers from Apache
            servers with Passenger and tested in a painful combination of shell
            scripts, Rake, RSpec, Capybara, Selenium and Firefox, all in virtual
            framebuffer for capturing errors not visible to the browser.
        </p><p>
            To allow developers to write tests for the Big Smoke, I created
            the Smoke Rig - single box version of the environment, intended to run
            in a VM. The Rig could run all the tests just like the main instance,
            but without the remote deployment and load balancing.

            The project aimed to move Aframe services to professional SaaS/IaaS
            approach, hopefully allowing to fine-cut our offer for widely
            varying types of customers in video production market as well as increased
            resilience against deployment issues, network failures and hardware
            problems.
        </p><p>
            Flagship milestone was the Transcode Farm - a specification
            for a cluster of batch-processing machines specialized in the most
            intricate part of Aframe services - transcoding video files between
            different (professional) formats. The Farm aimed to split the task
            between dozens of Docker containers within OpenStack instance,
            allowing to finely control the amount of procesing power committed
            to a given set of transcoding processes in a manner similar to
            Heroku's dynos.
        </p><p>
            IaaS control was to be provided by OpenStack with associated
            products. Issues caused by OpenStack's immaturity (particularly
            networking quirks) and Docker's limitations (one part of the
            architecture required a container within a container which made its way to Docker
                about a year later) were never fully
            resolved throughout project's lifetime.
        </p><p>
            All machines involved were provisioned in fully automatic manner,
            with Vagrant, Chef, Kitchen CI for testing and Docker for isolation.
            After development and testing phase for the nodes, deployment would
            be performed using pre-rendered images with history and instant
            fallbacks.
        </p><p>
            My part focussed on utilising the emerging Aurora toolkit
            and workflow for infrastructure overhaul of The Big Smoke. The work
            was never completed due to Aurora being incinerated amidst joyful
            dances and songs of the most senior developers immediately after the
            project author's resignation.

                of messages, fields and logical conditions. Scans
                current message routing configuration (XML) and
                simulates proper routing, finally comparing resulting
                data streams and reporting items lost, modified and
                unexpected.

                Scripting in bash, awk, sed and whatever else happens to be
                part of RHEL6 and help with providing full automation and
                regression suite for the project.
            </li><li>
                Design improvement suggestions, cooperation with development
                regarding current bugs and release process, test cases review,
                creation and execution.
            </li><li>
                Providing estimates of effort required by various stages of
                automation and looking for ways of structurizing its development
                in a manner understandable by the higher management.

            My contribution involved scripting in Python to implement the most
            complicated modules in a self-developed (from the scratch)
            performance testing platform for use on a 300 box cluster.
            The platform:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    scheduled tasks execution across the boxes and
                    cache-coherent cores on the boxes,
                </li><li>
                    tracked resource consumption on all boxes and latencies on
                    selected ones
                </li><li>
                    gathered the results, plotting them with gnuplot
                    and organizing all the charts into a comprehensible webpage
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've used Python to parse and instantiate configuration
            templates and shell scripts, then to write the HTML presentation
            of result charts.

            Project's objective was to facilitate transition from an
            in-house developed system based on a mainframe and AS/400's
            to Windows application named Ubix, which was back then
            marketed by a French vendor looking to gain foothold in
            American market.
        </p>
        <p>
            My key tasks included gathering requirements from the client
            (Prudential Bache Commodities), mapping them to existing
            Ubix functions and Change Requests, designing test cases
            resulting from the requirements, finally registering,
            tracking and executing them in Quality Center. I did however
            manage to put my developer skills to work in following areas:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Customization of defect lifecycle by extensive
                    scripting in Visual Basic with HPQC APIs.
                </li><li>
                    Data reconciliation between mainframe VSAM tables
                    exports and Oracle SQL dumps, using JavaScript with
                    WSH. The scripts included GUI based on MSIE
                    (dynamically written HTML pages with forms and
                    scripting the browser window from outside) and
                    - due to complexity coupled with lack of
                    modularization in WSH - a simple utility to import
                    modules in manner of other languages' require_once()
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            In initial stages of project I felt that some general
            background research on both the client and the vendor might be
            needed - a sort of Due Diligence, which I have done as a voluntary
            side-project. The results of that research were first shelved by my
            company (large scale projects were not easy to secure in 2008) and
            later confirmed by 2009 acquisition of Ubix along with its vendor by
            its main American would-be-competitor Sungard and by 2010 sale of
            Prudential's whole derivatives business to Jefferies. I consider
            that due diligence work and the document summarizing it my best
            achievement so far in the fields of
            <ul>
                <li>
                    estimating general [un]usability of a  product in a specific
                    busisness,
                </li><li>
                    identifying key risk introduced by client's and product's
                    specificities (incompatibilities) and
                </li><li>
                    predicting long-term results of pursuing a high-risk endeavour
                    without any actual visible opportunity.
                </li>

            <li>
                It was my sole project while working for Softbank SA
                (later to become Asseco Poland).
            </li><li>
                With over 200 people involved over many years, it was one
                of the largest (and most successful) projects on Polish IT
                business scene so far, delivered by a consortium of
                Asseco Poland and Accenture.
            </li><li>
                The project was highly specific, with RUP as base
                methodology and high fidelity to actual agile paradigms
                for a project of such size and for so heavily corporate
                environment - from TDD through shortest possible
                development cycles to close contact with the client
                (every development team had an active member being the
                bank's employee). Quality and resilience of the code
                was extremely high as a result of extreme approach to
                testing and elitistic HR policies.
            </li><li>
                I was hired by Softbank as a graduate-level programmer
                and left Asseco Poland as a senior designer leading
                a small sub-team of programmers 3 years later.
            </li><li>
                In the meantime I was responsible for a wide variety of
                tasks in the Infrastructure Team, progressively:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Coding in COBOL, SQL and JCL; executing unit and
                        integration testing; tracking results in ClearQuest
                    </li><li>
                        Designing components basing on High-Level Design
                        documents, including programs, batches, database
                        objects and CICS interfaces. Reviewing code of my
                        team-mates. Designing unit and integration tests.
                    </li><li>
                        Preparing High-Level Designs based on Statements of
                        Work (slightly processed user requirements). Designing
                        GUI elements for system's front-end, processing flows
                        and data models. Creating test plans. Reviewing detailed
                        designs of components, code and tests.
                    </li><li>
                        Delivering training for new employees, including
                        technology and basic business specifics.
                    </li><li>
                        Supervising production roll-outs of new code delivered
                        by the team.
                    </li><li>
                        Preparing Statement of Work documents from user
                        requirements. Reviewing high level designs, test plans
                        and GUI drafts.
                    </li><li>
                        Structurizing training schedule to facilitate
                        progressing step-by-step introduction to the project.
                        Preparing training materials.
                    </li><li>
                        Delegating tasks to members of the subteam, reviewing
                        their deliverables and tracking their progress.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                My favourite achievement on the project was wide
            adoption (by other project teams) of the set of coding, designing
            and testing guidelines I had written for my sub-team. I suspect
            the chief reason for that to have happened were some of the more useful
            code snippets I included, but I did receive very positive
            feedback regarding the whole document and the idea it was born of.
